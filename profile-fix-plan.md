# Profile Picture Upload Fix Plan

## Issue Analysis
The profile picture upload appears to have frontend and backend issues:
1. Frontend: JavaScript handling of file upload confirmation
2. Backend: File processing and storage issues
3. Form submission flow problems

## Root Causes Identified

### Backend Issues:
1. **Storage path issues**: Using `storage/` prefix which may conflict with Laravel's storage system
