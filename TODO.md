# Attendance Logout Issue - Fixed

## Issue Description
Students were being automatically logged out when making attendance due to problematic auto-logout logic in the QR scanner.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **JavaScript Auto-Logout**: The QR scanner automatically logged out students who scanned while having an active session
2. **User Controller Logic**: Complex logic for handling rejected borrow requests was creating duplicate attendance records
3. **Borrow Request Logic**: Overly restrictive borrow request validation

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed JavaScript Auto-Logout Logic
- **File**: `resources/js/scan-attendance.js`
- **Change**: Removed automatic logout when student has active session
- **New Behavior**: Shows informative message instead of auto-logout

### 2. Simplified User Attendance Controller Logic
- **File**: `app/Http/Controllers/User/AttendanceController.php`
- **Change**: Removed complex rejected request handling that created duplicate records
- **New Behavior**: Normal attendance flow regardless of rejected borrow requests

### 3. Improved Borrow Request Validation
- **File**: `app/Http/Controllers/User/AttendanceController.php`
- **Change**: Only prevent borrowing the same book, not all borrowing activities
- **New Behavior**: Students can borrow different books even with pending requests

### 4. Updated Activity Display
- **File**: `resources/js/scan-attendance.js`
- **Change**: Fixed activity display function to properly show "Borrow book rejected"
- **New Behavior**: Consistent red badge for rejected borrow requests

## Expected Behavior After Fixes
- Students can scan QR codes without being automatically logged out
- Rejected borrow requests don't interfere with normal attendance
- Students can borrow different books even with pending requests
- Clear visual indicators for all borrow request statuses
- No duplicate attendance records created

## Testing Recommendations
- Test normal attendance login/logout flow
- Test borrow request approval/rejection flow
- Test multiple borrow requests for different books
- Test real-time attendance updates
- Test QR scanning with active sessions
